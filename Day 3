IO Placer Revision
      OpenLANE configurations can be changed inside the shell itself, on the fly. IO Mode is usually set to random equidistant. 
SPICE Deck Creation For CMOS Inverter
SPICE Simulation Lab for CMOS Inverter
      The start of SPICE simulation is .op where in Vin will be swept from 0 to 2.5 with 0.05V steps. 
  For SPICE simulation, there are various steps-:
          Open the NGSPICE simulator
          Source the Circuit File through source command
          Execute it by the command run and then use setplot which allows one to view any plots possible from the simulations specified in the spice deck and will give you a choice for which simulation to be run
          Then, type display which will give you a choice of nodes to be plotted which when plot out vs in is typed will be plotted on a graph.
