RTL2GDS Using TritonRoute and OpenSTA
Routing and Design Check

Introduction to Maze Routing and Lee's Algorithm
There have been many routing algorithms created like Steiner Tree algorithm, Line Search algorithm etc. and one such algorithm we will go into detail is Maze Routing 
Intialization
  * obstacle 
  * empty 
  * visited 
  * source 
  * target
Wave Expansion
Backtracking and Path Reconstruction 

Design Rule Check
    When we route, we do not just merely connect two points, we must also adhere to certain rules. 

Power Distribution Network and Routing
Lab Steps
Go to the openlane directory
Enter the command docker and then ./flow.tcl -interactive
Enter package require openlane 0.9.
Enter prep -design picorv32a -tag
Then type echo $::env /openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/runs/results/cts/picorv32a.cts.def
To generate the PDN


Basics of Global and Detail Routing and Configure TritonRoute
  TritonRoute is the engine that is used for routing through the run_routing command.

Global Route
Fast Route

TritonRoute Features
      It perform inital detail route
      Honours the preprocessed route guides
      Satify inter guide connectivity

It should be unit width
It should be preferred direction
