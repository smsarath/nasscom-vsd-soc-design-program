Section 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
Section 1 tasks:-

    Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
    Calculate the flop ratio
    Flop Ratio = No. of D Flip Flops/ Total No, of Cells
                = 1613/ 14876
                = 0.108
              
Percentage of D Flip FLops = 10.84%
