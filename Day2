Chip Floor Planning Considerations

Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio

The first step in physical design is to define the width and height of the core and die.
Beginning with a very simple netlist, that can extrapolated later we will first draw a basic diagram in the form of symbols that we will later convert into physical designs. 

Utilisation factor = Area occupied by netlist / Total area of core

Utilisation factor = 50 %

Aspect Ratio = 2 : 4 = 1 : 2 = .5

Concept of Pre-Placed Cells

Pre-Placed cells are complex logic blocks that can be reused. 
They are already implemented and cannot be touched by Auto Place and Route tools - and hence are required to be very well designed. 
Placement of such cells are user-based. 

De-Coupling Capacitors

We surround pre-placed cells with de-coupling capacitors. 
If we think of a circuit to be part of a block, whenever it is switched on there is a demand for current, which is supplied by the Vdd. 
Upon switching the circuit off, there is a discharge, which the ground accepts. 

Power Planning
Consider a particular piece of logic to be a macro, that is repeated many times on a single chip.
It requires a lot of voltage, so voltage must be supplied through a decoupling capacitor. 

A lot of capacitors discharging at once cam cause Ground Bounce due to great amount of voltage needed to drained at the same time.
Turning the capacitor on might cause Voltage Drop due to insufficient current.

Pin Placement and Logical Cell Placement Blockage
he input and output ports are placed left and right between the core and the die respectively. 
The placements of the ports is cell-specific. The clocks are continuously drive the cells and hence clock ports are bigger than data ports. 
Due to this, we also need the least resistance paths for the clocks. The size is inversely proportional to the resistance.
